# Infant Warmer Simulation – Neonatal Care Support System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of Semester 2 coursework in Electromedical Engineering.  
The Infant Warmer system is designed to simulate neonatal care support by maintaining optimal temperature and monitoring vital signs.

## 🔧 Main Components
- LM35 Temperature Sensor: Detects ambient and baby’s skin temperature.
- Temperature Stabilizer Block: Controls heating and cooling with heater + fan.
- 7-Segment Display: Shows actual vs. set temperature.
- Comparator: Compares measured temperature with set point for control.
- Blue LED + Microcontroller: Activates phototherapy block based on timer.
- Pulse Sensor + Timer: Monitors baby’s BPM (beats per minute).
- PSU: Provides power to the entire system.

## 📊 Features
- Real-time temperature monitoring and control.
- Visual display of set and actual temperature.
- Integrated phototherapy with timer control.
- Heart rate monitoring with pulse sensor.
